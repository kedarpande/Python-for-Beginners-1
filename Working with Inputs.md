### The Gifts from the Users
Any information or data that is sent to a program for processing is considered ` Input `.But before you can play with Inputs, you need to store it in a place called ` Variables`.
### Where to store the Gifts
The gifts from the users are stored in a place called `Variable`.
#### Variable
 Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. 
 This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.
 Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.
 
 Python handles variable in a most efficient way. You name it, python handles it for you.
 ```python
 >>>name="Satyaki"
 >>>name
 >>>Satyaki
 >>>roll=14
 >>>roll
 >>>14
 ```
 Here we can see, we can store any values in a variable without even informing python about its type.
 Values like `Integers`,`Whole Number` can be directly assigned to a variable, while values like `String` need special attention.
 Any string values are placed within `" "` or `' ' ` while assigning to a variable.
 You can use any notation, but sticking to one makes it easy for understanding.
 ### Accepting the Gifts and Keeping it in proper place
 Now when we have ideas about the `inputs` and `variables`, its important to combine them together.
 Let us consider the following code:
 
 ```python
 
 >>>name=input("What is Your Name?")              #Line1
 ...What is Your Name?                            #Line2
 ...Satyaki                                       #Line3
 >>>age=input("What is Your age?")              
 ...What is Your age?
 ...24
 >>>print("Hi ", name)                            #Line4
 >>>Hi Satyaki
 >>>age                                           #Line5
 >>>24
 
 ```
